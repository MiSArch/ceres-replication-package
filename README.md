# Master's Thesis Replication Package

This replication package allows you to recreate the scientifc studys and experiments conducted during the Master's Thesis "Customizable Chaos Experiment Framework for the MiSArch Microservice Reference Architecture" by Elias Müller.

It contains four parts:
1. The requirements engineering (RE) documents in the `Requirements_Engineering` directory, containing the interview questions and responses of the RE phase and the resulting list of requirements.
2. The architectural decision records (ADRs) in the `System_Design` directory, containing the list of ADRs which were decided upon during the system design of the resulting MiSArch Experiment Tool.
3. The usability study in the evaluation phase in the `Evaluation_User_Study` directory, containing the task definition for the usability evaluation of the MiSArch Experiment Tool and the results, both as Excel and properly formatted in a PDF.
4. The results of the experiments made using the MiSArch Experiment Tool in the `Evaluation_SLO_Experiments` directory, which contains the results of the different experiment runs and a guide how to recreate the experiment results for validation.
5. Some screenshots of the Frontend and the Dashboard which might be hard to read in the thesis can be found in the `Screenshots` directory.
6. The actual source code of the MiSArch Experiment Tool, without MiSArch, including a docker-compose and necessary config files is packed as a zip-file in the `misarch-experiment-tool` directory.
